# Expense Tracker  Next Js 
This guide illustrates the process of setting up your monthly income and expenses. First, begin by calculating your desired monthly budgetâ€”the amount you plan to spend. Once you have 
established this budget, you can track your monthly expenditures, monitoring how much you spend in relation to your set budget.

By following this system, you gain a clear overview of your financial landscape, allowing you to see all of your expenses alongside your income. This not only helps you manage your 
finances more effectively but also empowers you to make informed decisions about your spending habits. With consistent tracking, you can identify areas where you might need to cut back
or adjust your budget, ultimately leading to greater financial stability and peace of mind.

By understanding your financial flow, you take an important step towards achieving your financial goals.
